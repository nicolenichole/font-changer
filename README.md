This Chrome extension allows users to change the font of text on any webpage. It includes several font options, including **OpenDyslexic**, a font designed to improve readability for people with dyslexia.

## Features

- Includes popular fonts like **Arial**, **Comic Sans MS**, **Georgia**, **OpenDyslexic**, and more.
- Revert back to the original website font using the **Original font** option.
- Simple and easy-to-use interface.

## Why I Made This
As someone who struggles with dyslexia, I know how frustrating it can be to read dense or cluttered text online. I first discovered the OpenDyslexic font while reading on my Kindle, and it made a huge difference in how easily I could process and enjoy written content. I wanted to bring that same experience to the web, so I created this extension to let myself — and others — read more comfortably on any website.

## Installation
1. Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open **Chrome** and go to the Extensions page by navigating to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle switch in the top right).
4. Click the **Load unpacked** button.
5. Select the directory where you have your extension files.

## How to Use
1. Once the extension is installed, click the extension icon in the top-right corner of Chrome.
2. In the dropdown that appears, select a font from the list.
   - **Original font**: Reverts the text to the webpage’s default font.
   - **OpenDyslexic**: Applies the OpenDyslexic font.
   - Other font options include **Arial**, **Baskerville**, **Calibri**, **Comic Sans MS**, **Garamond**, **Georgia**, **Times New Roman**, and **Courier New**.
3. The selected font will be applied immediately to the text on the webpage.

Note: This extension works on most websites, but some pages with custom styling or dynamic content may not fully reflect the font change.
